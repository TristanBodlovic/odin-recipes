<p>Lasagna is a traditional Italian dish made of layers of wide, flat pasta sheets alternated with rich meat or vegetable sauce, creamy béchamel, and melted cheese. It’s baked in the oven until golden and bubbling, creating a comforting and hearty meal. Originating from Italy, lasagna is now enjoyed worldwide in many variations, from classic Bolognese to vegetarian and seafood versions.</p>

    <li>Top it off: Finish with a layer of sauce and plenty of shredded cheese.</li>
    <li>Bake: Cover with foil and bake at 180°C (350°F) for about 30–40 minutes, then uncover and bake another 10–15 minutes until golden and bubbling.</li>
    <li>Rest and serve: Let it sit for 10–15 minutes before serving so the layers hold together.</li>
